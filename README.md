# MEANTODO
Simple SPA todo app using Mongo Express Angular Node and Skeleton as the CSS framework.
Done using MVC architecture to seperate concerns. 
Plans to add a nested controller and view to have sub todo's that can be added inside the main todo model.
Live app 
Missing any type of user authentication. Collaborative todo? Yay
